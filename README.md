# Syn-Flood-Attack
This was my first script to conduct an attack. I wrote it quickly for my Network Security as part of an assignment to conduct the attack on a virtual machine running locally. The assignment was to conduct the attack, detect the attack taking place and then reporting it.

The script is just a quick and easy syn-flood attack to attack a specified IP over a specific port it Performs IP Masking too.

Code runs by performing a simple syn-flood attack on a device in your network.
  1. Assign the target IP Address to the target_ip variable in line 3
  2. Assign the target port to the target_port variable in line 5
